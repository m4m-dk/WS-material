Get an **ORCID**
Get an account for **GitHub**

Make sure that the e-mail address you provide is either a gmail address or linked to a Google account (find a tutorial here) 
Send e-mail addresses, ORCIDs and GitHub user name to hannah.mihai@deic.dk, so you can be added to DeiCs Slack channel, GitHub repository, and CEDAR folder minimum 1 week before the workshop (deadline 06.04.21)
 
Mandatory for the group:
Select datasets for which you want to create machine-actionable metadata. Selected datasets should not contain sensitive data and ideally should be already public.
Determine relevant domain specific standards, subject terms and concepts, variables etc.
 
It is mandatory to select at least one person (preferably two), who will volunteer to be the groups data champion - someone who is dedicated to continue to lead the groups work towards FAIR metadata after the workshop is completed. Let DeiC know who will take these roles. Each data champion will work towards becoming an expert in developing and maintaining:
Controlled vocabularies, starting with simple tools such as: https://excel2rdf.readthedocs.io
Metadata templates using the CEDAR workbench: watch/read the tutorial
 
If you are not already familiar with the topic, it is nice to:
Read the FAIRytale to get acquainted with the basic concepts of FAIR
Navigate https://howtofair.dk/ to get a further impression of what going FAIR means from a practical perspective
