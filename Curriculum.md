| 1   | 0:10       | **Welcome - motivations and practicalities**<br />**Summary:** Short introduction  about the workshop                  | 
| 2   | 0:20       | **Introduction to linked (meta)data and machine-actionability** <br />**Summary:** Non technical introduction to linked (meta)data and machine-actionability. In this presentation we will present and highlight key mechanisms and components that make (meta)data machine-actionable and linked to other resources out in the Web.|
| 3   | 0:30       | **How to build machine-actionable controlled vocabularies?** <br />**Summary:** Controlled terminologies, such as vocabularies and ontologies, are one of the most essential components in achieving machine-actionability and (meta)data linking. Without them we are left with free text inputs which are difficult if not impossible to be understood by machines, and often lead to false interpretation by humans. Since often existing controlled terminologies arenâ€™t sufficient to cover needs of particular domains, we will learn how to build them.|

| 4   | 2:45       | **Building domain specific controlled vocabularies of variables and research topics** <br />**Summary:** What differentiate one research domain from another are variables contained in data and what research topics they are investigating with data. Therefore, in this hands-on exercise we will start to build the corresponding controlled vocabularies and publish them on OntoStack and BioPortal. On the second day we will use these vocabularies to update a generic metadata template to be domain specific.|
| 5   | 0:15       | **Round-off and what happens next?** <br /> **Summary:** A quick summary of what we did during the first day of M4M and a prelude to day 2 of M4M.|
