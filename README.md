# WS-material

This repository contains material for the M4M workshop organised by DeiC in collaboration with GO-FAIR.

You can find here the **homework** (which needs to be done before the WS begins), the **curriculum** (which is still under construction) and the **Rules of Engagement** for everyone involved in the workshop (organizers, participants, observers).
